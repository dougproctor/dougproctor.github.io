  <h2> Origin </h2>

  <p> Tiny Talk was created in August 2020 by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/doug-proctor-10337624/">Doug Proctor</a> during the COVID-19 pandemic in an effort to help people stay connected to the people that matter to them. Doug is indebted to his family and friends, without whom Tiny Talk would not exist.</p>

  <h2> Mission </h2>

  <p> The mission of Tiny Talk is to help people strengthen real, meaningful relationships by leveraging social serendipity.

  <h2> ... another social network app? Wait but why? </h2>

  <p> We built Tiny Talk to make it easier for people to stay connected in real and meaningful ways with the people who matter to them. Our motivation to build Tiny Talk was in part fueled by the following observations:</p>
  <p> 1. Because we are spending so much more time at home, we are missing the serendipitous encounters of everyday life. We don't run into friends in the park and at restaurants as we used to, and our unplanned social encounters with friends have morphed into 30 minute scheduled zoom calls and hang-outs.</p>
  <p> 2. The vast majority of existing social network tools have a one-to-many structure -- you can post, tweet, snap, and share every waking moment, but it's harder than ever to actually connect. Our aim with Tiny Talk is to facilitate the type of real, meaningful and spontaneous one-to-one interactions that we feel are missing -- and to make them easy, low-commitment and fun.</p>
  <p> 3. All in all, our mission with Tiny Talk is to bring back social serendipity in order help people stay connected to the people that matter to them. </p>

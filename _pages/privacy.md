<h2>PRIVACY POLICY</h2>

<h6>Last updated August 17, 2020</h6>

The Tiny Talk Privacy Policy is designed to help you understand the information we collect and the different ways we may use or share it.

This policy applies to your use of Tiny Talk. By "Tiny Talk,” we mean the Tiny Talk website, mobile app, and any other of our products and services that directly link to this policy.

And who are we? We’re Tiny Talk Inc. To learn more about privacy at Tiny Talk, please keep reading below! If you'd like to read our Terms of Service.

What Information We Collect

You probably wonder what information we collect. This often depends on the exact nature of our relationship with you and how you choose to use Tiny Talk, but we’ve described the most common examples below. We have broken these descriptions down into categories to make them clearer:

We collect account information. We collect information relating to your account. For example, we collect basic registration details like name, email address, birthday, and phone number when you create a Tiny Talk account. You may be able to share other account-related information with us too, like if you choose to provide a profile photo. We collect some information about your friends when you invite or refer them to Tiny Talk or import your contacts.

We collect usage information. We collect information about your interactions with and on Tiny Talk. For example, we collect information about how long you chat with your friends.

Tiny Talk uses this info to make the product better for you so you can focus on being present with your friends. We want to do the heavy lifting, utilizing tech to improve the experience.

We collect certain information when you link third party accounts or apps to Tiny Talk. If you link social media accounts to Tiny Talk, we collect certain social media account information. If you grant access to your contacts we collect information about your friends, like their names and phone numbers.

We may collect location information. For example, we may derive your location information based on your IP address.

We collect feedback information. We collect information that you give us when you complete a survey or participate in a contest or promotion. This includes when you write a review or make a suggestion.

We collect device information. We collect information about the browser or device you are using. We may look at what site you came from, or what site you visit when you leave us. We may also collect device identifiers. For example, this might include your operating system and hardware model. This may also include your mobile carrier.

Why We Collect Information

Now that you know what we collect, we want to tell you why and what we do with that information. Below we explain how we use information:

We use some information to communicate with you. We use information to respond to your questions, including questions about our services or your relationship with us, and to communicate with you about this policy or our Terms. We may also contact you about your feedback.

We just want to be able to be responsive to you, and occasionally reach out to hear how it’s going on Tiny Talk, and make sure you have updates on what’s going on with us!

We use some information so you can participate in Tiny Talk and to enhance your experience. We use information to process your registration and to empower you to use certain features. With your permission where required by law, for example, we use information to suggest other users with whom you may want to connect. We also use information so you can invite new people to join Tiny Talk and to provide or suggest specific features.

We help you find friends and make connections. For example, we might suggest a connection to you based on your friends on who could be a good addition to your contacts.

We use some information to improve our products. We use information to make Tiny Talk better, for example by saving certain preferences you choose, tracking events in Tiny Talk, and recording other performance data. We use this information to customize your experience, analyze product trends, and to develop and improve our products.

We use some information for marketing purposes. We use your information to share updates about new products and special offers, including promotions, surveys, and contests, through email, on our app, or on social media platforms. We might also use this information to tell you about products and offers, new features, or updates. These might be our own offers or products or select third-party offers or products we think you might find interesting.

We use information to protect our company and users. We use information to protect our company and users, for example to identify fraud and secure, protect accounts, and protect Tiny Talk. This includes looking into potentially prohibited or illegal activity.

We may also use push notifications in our mobile apps. We may send you push notifications about updates and other information we think you will find interesting, for example to let you know when a friend is online.

Our basis for processing European information. Our basis for processing your information for the reasons described above is typically to perform a contract, including responding to your requests. For example, this includes providing customer service. Where this applies, if you choose not to provide information, we may be unable to perform the contract or respond to your request. We also process information based on your consent. Where you have provided consent, you have the right to withdraw it. We also use information about you when we have a legitimate purpose in doing so. For example, this includes helping secure and improve Tiny Talk.

We also use information as otherwise permitted by law.

How We Collect Information

Like many other companies, there are different ways that we collect information, which we’ve outlined below:

We collect information directly from you. You might provide us information in several ways. For example, we collect information when you create an account, contact us, or participate in a survey.

We collect information passively. We use tracking tools to collect information from you passively. These tools include things like browser cookies and web beacons. We use these on our sites and in emails that we send to you. We collect this information about users over time when you download and use our app.

The information we gather helps us give you the best experience on Tiny Talk.

We get information about you from third parties. Social media platforms and third-party apps may give us information about you. We may also collect information about you from other users. This might include your name, phone number, or email address if they invite or refer you to our app or if they have linked their contacts to their Tiny Talk account.

What social platforms are we talking about? We might get information, for example, from Snapchat or Facebook if you choose to link your Tiny Talk account with these third-party platforms. Information they share with us includes certain details from your profile.

We combine information. Tiny Talk is an integrated social media platform, which means we may combine information that we have collected across devices, such as computers and mobile devices. We may also combine information we get from a third party with information we already have and combine information that we have collected from other third-party sites.

When We Share Information
Tiny Talk is part of the digital community, and as part of our business there are times that we share information with third parties. You can find out more about that here:

Sharing on Tiny Talk. Tiny Talk is designed to let you join video chats. Other users may also be able to view your name, username, and top Connections (i.e., who you speak to most often). Connections can see when you were online last and a list of some of your other Connections.

Tiny Talk exists to help you connect with the people you care about most. When you connect with your friends, they can see some of the profile information you’ve created on Tiny Talk.

We share information with our vendors. We may share information with trusted third parties, including companies who serve as our vendors and help us deliver our services and social media partners if you elect to use social media integration features. We may also share some information with companies that help operate our app or run a promotion.

We will share information if we think we have to in order to comply with the law or to protect ourselves. For example, we will share information to respond to a court order or subpoena or if a U.S. or non-U.S. law enforcement agency, government agency, or investigatory body requests it. We may also share information we collect when we investigate potential fraud, abuse, or other similar violations of Tiny Talk rules and codes of conduct.

We may share information with any successor to all or part of our business. If all or part of our business is sold, we’re part of a merger or acquisition, or there is a financing or bankruptcy, we may share information as part of that transaction.

We may also share information for other reasons we may describe to you or as permitted under law.

Your Choices

You have certain choices about how we use your information. Those are described here:

You can opt out of certain marketing. To stop receiving our promotional emails or communications follow the instructions in any promotional message you get from us. If you opt out of getting marketing messages, you will continue to receive non-marketing messages from us about your relationship with us where permitted by law.

You can control certain aspects of your interactions with others on Tiny Talk. Tiny Talk is meant to offer a fun way for people to interact with other people in ways similar to how you might in-person. However, your settings do give you certain controls over your video conversations, such as turning off your video during a chat.

You can control certain notifications settings. If you don't want to receive notifications when other users sort you into a group, you can do so in settings.

You can control cookies and tracking tools. Your browser may give you the ability to control cookies or other tracking tools. How you do so depends on the type of tool. Certain browsers can be set to reject browser cookies.

Our Do Not Track Policy: You may change your browser settings or take other steps to block, manage, or delete cookies. Not all of our websites and online services currently respond to browser “do not track” signals, so you will need to use your browser settings to effectively manage cookies. In some cases, blocking or disabling cookies may cause Tiny Talk not to work as intended and some features may not be available.

You can control certain settings on your mobile device. For example, you can turn off push notifications on your phone. To modify the push notifications you get from us, you can change your preferences in Tiny Talk settings. You also can modify app level permissions, such as access to contacts, microphone or camera through your device settings.

You May Have Certain Additional Rights

In some places laws grant residents certain additional rights. We have described those rights in the relevant sections here:

Children’s Privacy

Tiny Talk is intended to be appropriate for general audiences and is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not intentionally collect personal information from children under 13, and if we learn that we have unintentionally collected any such information, we will promptly take steps to delete it and terminate the child’s account.

How We Protect Information

We maintain appropriate administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your personal information from accidental, unlawful, or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure, or use and other unlawful forms of processing. You should keep your user credentials and password confidential and secure so that your information is protected.

We work hard to protect your data, but the Internet is not 100% secure. We encourage you to use caution online. This includes not sharing or reusing your passwords and not accepting friend requests from strangers.

Transfers of Information

Tiny Talk is based in the United States, which means the information we collect may be processed and stored within the United States. If you live outside of the United States and choose to use Tiny Talk, you understand that your information may be processed outside your country of residence, including in other jurisdictions (like the United States) that may have different data protection frameworks than your region. We keep personal information as long as it is necessary or relevant for the practices described in this policy and as otherwise required by law.

Information we transfer from Europe to the United States is subject to appropriate safeguards under applicable law.

Third-Party Sites

We may link to third-party sites or apps. Tiny Talk may also include third-party content that collects information. We do not control these third parties. This policy does not apply to the privacy practices of these third-party websites or apps. Please read the privacy policies of other websites carefully. We are not responsible for the practices of these third-party sites or apps.

<h2>Tiny Talk Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<br>

<h3>What is Tiny Talk?</h3>

> Tiny Talk is a mobile app that aims to bring back the social serendipity of everyday life in the post-COVID world. From time to time, Tiny Talk will invite you to join a seven-minute, randomly coordinated video chat with one of your contacts that you've pre-approved. It's like Chat Roulette, but with your friends (and not creepy).

<h3>How does it work?</h3>

> Tiny Talk lets you sort your contacts: friends, family, work, other -- or, block a contact, which means you won't ever be matched with them. After sorting your contacts, you'll from time to time receive an invite to join a Tiny Talk -- this invite is double-blind, meaning neither you nor the person you'll be matched with will know the identity of the other person until you both opt-in. Once you match, you'll be automatically connected for a seven-minute video chat -- just a fun little exchange.

<h3>... another social network app? Wait but why?</h3>

> We built Tiny Talk to enable friends to connect in fun, real and random ways.
> Our motivation to build Tiny Talk was in part fueled by the following observations:
> 1. One of the things many of us have lost in the post-COVID world is serendipity. We don't run into friends in the park and at restaurants as we used to, and our unplanned social encounters with friends have morphed into 30 minute scheduled zoom calls and hang-outs.
>
> 2. The vast majority of existing social network tools have a one:many structure -- you can post, tweet, snap, and share every waking moment, but it's harder than ever to actually connect. Our aim with Tiny Talk is to facilitate the type of real, meaningful and spontaneous one:one interactions that we feel are missing -- and to make them easy, low-commitment and fun.
>
> All in all, our mission with Tiny Talk is to bring all of us just a little bit closer to the people we care about.

<h3>Why seven minutes?</h3>

> The goal of Tiny Talk is to create a low-commitment experience that still allows for a meaningful exchange. Hence, Tiny Talks are capped at seven minutes.
> If seven minutes is too long, you can always end the call early. Or, if your Tiny Talk sparks something and seven minutes is not enough, just call the person back! Tiny Talks are intended as hors d'oeuvres - if you're still hungry, call them back!

<h3>How do I get Tiny Talk?</h3>

> Tiny Talk is available for iOS and Android devices on the Apple App Store and the Google Play store. Access is currently limited, but <a href ="https://tinytalk.io/signup"> sign up </a> now for an exclusive invite which you can share with your friends.

<h3>Can other users see when I block or sort them into a group?</h3>

> Other users will not be able to tell that you have blocked them -- you will simply never match with a blocked user. Similarly, other users will not know what group you've sorted them into.

<h3>Why don't I see one of my contacts in my "stack" of people to sort?</h3>

> Your "stack" is generated based on those of your phone contacts that have registered for Tiny Talk. If one of your contacts does not show up in your "stack," it is because they have not registered for Tiny Talk with a phone number in your contacts. **Invite friends** to join to expand the set of people you can connect with on Tiny Talk!

<h3>How do I share Tiny Talk with my friends?</h3>

> Once you've secured an exclusive early invite to use Tiny Talk, you can share Tiny Talk with your friends in the app.

<h3>Will other users see when I decline to join a Tiny Talk?</h3>

> Nope! If it's not a good time, decline away. The only time another user will identify you is after you have opted-in to a Tiny Talk and successfully matched. You can also adjust your notification preferences and availability windows in the app Settings.

<h3>Can I turn off video and just do audio chat?</h3>

> Yep! Video for Tiny Talk's are default on, but you can turn the video off if you prefer to only use voice chat.

<h3>What do you do with my data?</h3>

> The short answer is that we don't sell or user your data in any way other than to provide you with a great product and user experience. You can find all the nitty gritty legalese in our <a href= "https://tinytalk.io/terms"> Terms of Service </a> and <a href="https://tinytalk.io/privacy"> Privacy Policy </a>.

<h3>How do I get in touch to share my idea or to provide feedback?</h3>

> We love hearing from you, so don't hesitate to get in touch with questions, ideas or feedback!

  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

  <h3> What is Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p>Tiny Talk is a mobile app that makes it easy to spontaneously connect with the people that matter to you for short, random, one-on-one video chats.</p>

  <h3> How does it work? </h3>

    <p> Tap a button to connect with one of your personal contacts at random for a seven-minute one-on-one video chat. Or, drop in for Tiny Talk events to connect with your team at work (or any community you're a part of) for a series of random, back-to-back seven-minute catch-ups. </p>
    <p> Tiny Talk makes it simple to control which of your contacts you do (or don't) want to be eligible to connect with. Setting up Tiny Talk Channels takes about 30 seconds, so bringing your community together on Tiny Talk is a breeze! </p>

  <h3> How do I get Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talk is available for download on iOS on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiny-talk-chat/id1526380332?uo=4"> Apple App Store </a> and for Android on the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinytalkinc.tinytalk"> Google Play Store </a>.</p>

  <h3> Why seven minutes? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talks are meant to be fun, spontaneous and low-commitment -- seven minutes is just enough time to have a meaningful conversation, but short enough that they're easy to squeeze into hectic schedules and busy lives.<p>

  <h3> Who am I eligible to match with on Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talk makes it easy to connect either with your personal contacts, or with members of other Tiny Talk Channels. </p>
    <p> Channels are easy to create or join, and when you join a Channel, you become eligible to match with other users either via one-off Tiny Talks or through Channel events. To connect with your personal contacts on Tiny Talk, the other user must sign up for Tiny Talk, and you must be eligible to match with each other by sorting each other into contact groups. </p>

  <h3> Will other users know if I block them? </h3>

    <p> Nope! Other users will never know if you block them, or which contact group you sort them into. </p>

  <h3> Will other users see when I decline to join a Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p> Nope! If it's not a good time, decline away. Other users will only ever see your name pop up after you've decided to join a Tiny Talk and have successfully matched.</p>

  <h3> How do I reduce the volume of notifications from Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talk should never feel spammy or noisy -- it's easy to configure the types of notifications you do and don't want to receive by tapping the "Settings" button in the upper righthand corner of the app, and then tapping "App Settings."

  <h3> Can I turn off video and just do audio chat? </h3>

    <p> Yep! Video for Tiny Talk's are default on, but you can turn the video off if you prefer to only use voice chat.</p>

  <h3> My screen is black and/or my audio doesn't work during a Tiny Talk </h3>

    <p> If during a Tiny Talk you notice that your audio or video are having issues (e.g. you can't be heard or your screen is black), then it's very likely that you have not granted Tiny Talk the necessary camera and microphone permissions on your device. Go to your phone's privacy settings and ensure that Tiny Talk has access to your phone's microphone and camera. </p>
    <p> These permissions are only ever used to let you see and speak to other users during a Tiny Talk.</p>

  <h3> How do I share Tiny Talk with my friends? </h3>

    <p> You can invite friends to join Tiny Talk tapping the "Settings" button in the upper righthand corner of the app, and then tapping "Share Tiny Talk."</p>

  <h3> How do I stay in touch with someone from a Channel if we don't have each others' contact information? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talk makes it easy to securely share your contact information with other Channel users. To share your contact information, visit the other user's Channel profile page, tap "Share contact info" and then confirm whether you'd like to share your mobile number or email address. Tiny Talk will then send the user a text message with your contact information, and they will be able to reach out when they want to. </p>

  <h3> Why aren't some of my personal contacts showing up in Tiny Talk? </h3>

    <p> Your "stack" is generated based on those of your phone contacts that have registered for Tiny Talk. If one of your contacts does not show up in your "stack" (e.g. you're not able to sort them), it is because they have not registered for Tiny Talk or the number they registered with is not in your phone's contacts. Invite friends to join to expand the set of people you can connect with on Tiny Talk.</p>

  <h3> How much does it cost? </h3>

    <p> Tiny Talk is free to download and use for everyone. Whether you're using Tiny Talk to stay in touch for personal use, to meet others at your college or university, to help your remote team stay connected, or to increase engagement in your volunteer group, Tiny Talk is free.</p>

  <h3> What do you do with my data? </h3>

    <p> The short answer is that we don't sell or use your data in any way other than to provide you with a great product and user experience. You can find all the nitty gritty legalese in our <a href= "https://tinytalk.io/terms"> Terms of Service </a> and <a href="https://tinytalk.io/privacy"> Privacy Policy </a>.

  <h3> Are Tiny Talk conversations ever recorded or saved? </h3>

    <p> No. All Tiny Talk streaming audio and video content is ephemeral, meaning it's never recorded, stored or saved. Tiny Talk uses best in class tools and security protocols to ensure that conversations are always safe and secure.<p>
